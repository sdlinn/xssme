# xssme - revised
## A Chrome browser extension to detect XSS vulnerabilities in webpages.

OWASP defines XSS as “a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites.”

XSS Me was originally a Firefox extension developed by Security Compass for testing XSS vulnerabilities on user-defined websites.

xssme - revised is built using existing attack strings taken from XSS ME.



To run the php server locally: 

go to the website directory and run

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 -t .
```
